# Embedded Linux Project 1
## Three phase power synthetic data generator and broadcaster
Scripts and source files to generate and broadcast a synthetic three-phase AC waveform on an embedded platform, in this case, a Raspberry Pi 2.


## Embedded Development
A major challenge in developing on embedded platform is development and deployment. Difficulties include verifying correct compiler, setting up the hardware, and wrangling with networking issues - all before development can take place. To circumvent the issue, QEMU (Quick EMUlator) can be used to emulate the hardware; along with a cross-compiler on the development machine, the developer can comfortably architect, develop, and deploy software without logistical hubub.
